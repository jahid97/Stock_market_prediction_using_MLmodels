# Stock Market Prediction Using Machine Learning Models

This project demonstrates the use of machine learning techniques to predict stock market trends and prices. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation, using the Reliance stock dataset.

## Overview

The "Stock Market Prediction Using Machine Learning Models" project aims to provide insights into the stock market by leveraging historical data and machine learning algorithms. It addresses the challenges of stock market prediction by implementing robust preprocessing techniques, feature selection, and advanced regression models. Through this project, users can explore how machine learning models can predict stock prices and trends, making it a valuable tool for educational purposes and initial market analysis.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning of stock market data.
- Feature engineering to create meaningful inputs for machine learning models.
- Implementation of machine learning models for stock price prediction.
- Visualization of predictions against actual prices.
- Performance evaluation using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Stock_market_prediction_using_MLmodels.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Stock_market_prediction_using_MLmodels-main
   ```

3. Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scipy scikit-learn tensorflow google-colab ipython
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook file `stock_market_prediction_ML.ipynb`:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook stock_market_prediction_ML.ipynb
   ```

2. Run the cells sequentially to preprocess the data, train the models, and visualize the predictions.

3. Modify the dataset or model configurations as needed.

## Dataset

The project uses the Reliance stock dataset, available in the `dataset/RELIANCE.csv` file. This dataset contains historical stock prices, including features such as:

- Date
- Open price
- High price
- Low price
- Close price
- Volume

## Models Used

- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor
- SVM Algorithm
- LSTM Algorithm

Each model is trained and evaluated on the given dataset to determine its effectiveness in predicting stock prices.

## Results

- **Visualization**: Line plots comparing actual and predicted stock prices.
- **Metrics**: Performance evaluation using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²) scores.
